# RAPHAEL

A Python desktop voice assistant for Linux: speak to her, get spoken replies,
remember useful facts, and launch supported applications.

**Current version: 0.3.6 development.** Core voice, persistent memory, and the first
local actions are implemented. Live microphone, restart, and desktop acceptance
checks remain open in [release checks](docs/release-checks.md).

## What works today

- Local wake recognition and speech-to-text with Whisper; optional openWakeWord models.
- NVIDIA NIM, Groq, OpenRouter, and Ollama clients with routing and provider fallback.
- Default Amy speech through Piper, or RAPHAEL's custom Chatterbox Turbo voice
  when its separate model, environment, and reference assets are installed.
- Sentence-by-sentence speech while the provider is generating, interruption
  handling, and optional captions that follow playback.
- SQLite conversation history, background summaries, and persistent facts.
  Conversational facts need confirmation; explicit `remember ...` commands save directly.
- Local time/date, RAM usage, GPU temperature, CPU core count, and supported Linux app launching.
- Editable personality preferences, voice-requested style adjustments, and concise
  or development console output.

Web search, reminders, model-selected tool calls, a dashboard, messaging,
Windows support, tone detection, and presence detection are **planned**.
See the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) for implementation status and priorities.

## Install and start

Use **Python 3.10+** on Linux with a working microphone and audio output.
A GPU is optional for the default Amy/CPU setup. Initial package and model
installation needs internet access. Provider replies need a configured cloud
account or a running local Ollama server with a model installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hexarion0/Raphael.git
cd Raphael
bash setup.sh
.venv/bin/raphael start
```

The installer creates `.venv`, installs RAPHAEL, downloads default Amy and
Whisper `base.en`, and opens the configuration wizard for API keys, voice, and
audio devices. If `.env` already exists, it offers to reconfigure it.

For a manual installation:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e .
.venv/bin/raphael setup
.venv/bin/raphael start
```

Run these commands from the repository root. The wizard writes `.env` and tests
voice playback; it preserves unrelated settings on reconfiguration. Amy and Whisper
models download when first needed if they are not already present. Alternatively,
copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit it; the example uses Amy and CPU transcription.

Activation is optional with the commands above. In Bash/Zsh use
`source .venv/bin/activate`; in fish use `source .venv/bin/activate.fish`.
After activation, `raphael start` is equivalent to `.venv/bin/raphael start`.
If audio initialization reports a missing PortAudio library, install your
Linux distribution's PortAudio runtime and rerun setup.

### Choose a voice

Run `.venv/bin/raphael setup`:

| Choice | Voice | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | RAPHAEL custom voice | Chatterbox Turbo model, separate Python 3.12 environment, private reference audio/transcript, NVIDIA GPU |
| **2** | Default Amy | Piper voice model; CPU playback synthesis |

New installations default to **Amy**. Enter preserves an existing selection.
Custom voice setup saves the choice and checks local assets; it does **not**
install Turbo or recreate your private voice reference. Missing assets are listed
and the custom playback test is skipped until they are supplied.

The current local Turbo model occupies about **2.8 GiB**, and its Python environment
about **6 GiB**, in addition to the main application environment. These are
observed installation sizes, not minimum requirements or download-size guarantees.
The current worker requires CUDA and checks for at least **3,000 MiB free VRAM**
before loading. See [custom voice setup](docs/chatterbox-turbo-integration.md)
for the exact paths, model revision, and recorded hardware results.

The custom voice files are **not in Git**. Back up your reference audio/transcript
and custom Piper model separately if you want the same voice on another computer.
Turbo failures use the installed custom Piper fallback, then installed Amy;
a missing fallback does not trigger an automatic download during a voice reply.

### Provider configuration

The wizard accepts NIM, Groq, and OpenRouter API keys. Keep them in `.env`.
The current NIM default for both ordinary and complex requests is
`nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b`, selected in the recorded
[latency comparison](docs/conversation-latency.md). Override it with `NIM_MODEL`
and `NIM_COMPLEX_MODEL`; availability and latency depend on your provider account.
The model's official API example is available from [NVIDIA](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b/build).

Ollama is an optional local fallback, not bundled with RAPHAEL. It must be running
at `OLLAMA_HOST` with the requested model installed (currently `llama3.2` by default).
No provider setup is needed for local clock, memory, or supported desktop actions.

## Everyday use

```bash
.venv/bin/raphael start                    # concise console, wake-word mode by default
.venv/bin/raphael start dev                # detailed diagnostics
.venv/bin/raphael start --ambient          # optional continuous speech capture
.venv/bin/raphael start --show-ai-transcripts
.venv/bin/raphael setup                    # change voice, keys, or audio devices
```

Try:

- “Hey Raphael, what time is it?”
- “Raphael, how much RAM am I using?”
- “Raphael, can you open Discord for me?”
- “Raphael, my favorite game is CS2.” Then “Raphael, yes” to save it.
- “Raphael, what's my favorite game?”
- “Raphael, be more playful.”

Local app launching supports Discord/Vesktop, Firefox, Chromium, Steam, and
VS Code/VSCodium when installed on PATH. “Open it” can resolve a recent app name
or exact spelling correction for 60 seconds. Launches require a direct address
in ambient mode and accept no executable paths, shell commands, or flags.
A launch acknowledgement confirms process creation, not that a window appeared.

Copy `persona.example.txt` to ignored `persona.txt` to customize her style.
Preferences reload before each AI reply. Voice-requested changes update a managed
block; “reset your persona” clears that block while preserving your own text.
These preferences change reply style, not the actual TTS engine or playback speed.

### Listening and performance settings

| Setting | Fresh-install value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STT_MODEL` / `STT_DEVICE` | `base.en` / `cpu` | Command transcription |
| `WAKE_STT_MODEL` | `base.en` | Separate CPU wake recognizer |
| `UTTERANCE_SILENCE_SECONDS` | `0.7` | Silence before ending a turn |
| `UTTERANCE_PAUSE_GRACE_SECONDS` | `0.2` | Extra pause tolerance; total default 0.9 seconds |
| `AMBIENT_LISTENING` | `false` | Capture speech without a wake phrase |
| `AMBIENT_FOLLOWUP_SECONDS` | `300` | Active ambient conversation window |
| `BARGE_IN_MODE` | `wake` | Interrupt by name; use `speech` with headphones |
| `SHOW_TRANSCRIPTS` | `false` | Raw STT diagnostics in development output |
| `SHOW_AI_TRANSCRIPTS` | `false` | Captions during playback |

Increase pause grace if RAPHAEL cuts you off while thinking. The previous
1.8-second endpoint was more tolerant of pauses in recorded reference passages;
the current shorter default still needs live microphone acceptance.

For NVIDIA CUDA transcription, install `.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e ".[gpu]"`,
set `STT_DEVICE=cuda` and `STT_COMPUTE_TYPE=int8_float16`, then run
`./scripts/launch_raphael_gpu.sh`. This launcher prepares CUDA library paths;
it does not install models or force GPU settings. `small.en` is the model used
in the recorded GPU tests. Turbo has its own separate environment.

See [usage and tuning](docs/usage.md) for ambient follow-ups, strict mode,
interruption recovery, captions, memory behavior, and STT retry settings.

## Data and privacy

API keys, `persona.txt`, model weights, recordings, databases, and generated
benchmarks are excluded from Git. Accepted conversations are stored in
`data/raphael.db` by default. Forgetting a fact removes the structured memory
and suppresses known wording in provider context; it does not erase archived chats.

Wake recognition, transcription, and speech synthesis run locally. Cloud replies
send conversation context and relevant saved facts to the selected provider.
In ambient mode, short background excerpts stay temporarily in RAM and may be
sent to that provider to judge who is being addressed. There is no speaker
identification or acoustic echo cancellation. Diagnostic transcript logging can
expose nearby speech, so enable it deliberately.

## Development

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/pytest
.venv/bin/ruff check src tests
.venv/bin/python -m pip wheel . --no-deps -w dist
```

Ordinary tests use mocked devices/providers and exclude hardware integrations.
Run `.venv/bin/pytest -m integration` only with the required devices/models.
Optional wake training needs `pip install -e ".[train]"`; this is separate from
custom TTS inference. The supported custom Turbo path currently uses a source
checkout: its worker, manifest, and private assets are not bundled in the wheel.
