# RAPHAEL development roadmap

Last reviewed: **2026-10-08**. Package version: **0.3.6 development**.

The goal is a reliable personal desktop assistant with natural voice conversation,
persistent memory, useful actions, and eventually remote messaging and presence.
Linux is the current target. Build one feature at a time and verify its behavior
before treating it as ready for everyday use.

## Current status

| Area | Implemented | Still pending |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Voice loop | Wake recognition, local STT, provider streaming, sentence playback, interruptions, captions | Live microphone/speaker acceptance of the current combined changes |
| Voices | Default Piper/Amy; optional custom Turbo and local Piper fallback | Reproducible custom-voice installation and private asset import on a fresh machine |
| Providers | NIM, Groq, OpenRouter, Ollama, routing, retries/fallback, latency tracing | Usage totals, budget controls, broader live fallback verification |
| Memory | SQLite conversations, summaries, confirmed facts, corrections, forgetting, automated restart recall | Live voice-based restart acceptance |
| Actions | Trusted module discovery, validation, local telemetry, allowlisted Linux app launching | Model-selected calls, web search, reminders, live desktop launch acceptance |
| Personality | Editable preferences, curiosity, voice-requested style updates/reset | Continued evaluation during real conversations |
| Setup | Amy/custom voice choice, device/key configuration, missing-asset reporting | Automatic Turbo environment/model setup and clean-machine end-to-end validation |
| Dashboard, messaging, tone, Windows, presence | Planned | Implementation |

A checked item below means the implementation exists. It does not establish
microphone accuracy, speaker quality, or a completed release. Historical evidence
is in [release checks](release-checks.md), [latency findings](conversation-latency.md),
and the [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md). The repository has a `v0.2` tag; no stable
`v0.3` tag is recorded yet.

## Next work, in order

1. **Validate the current desktop build.** Run the live wake, conversation,
   interruption, custom-voice, memory restart, and Discord launch checks.
   Confirm the shorter 0.9-second endpoint does not cut off normal speech.
2. **Finish installation reproducibility.** Keep Amy as the simple default;
   install Turbo separately, import the user's private voice assets, and prove
   that the selected voice works after a fresh setup and restart.
3. **Add model-selected actions.** Let the provider select an existing action
   with structured arguments, while keeping local validation, authorization,
   cancellation, deadlines, and honest execution results.
4. **Add persistent reminders.** Start with relative reminders, list/cancel,
   restart recovery, and delivery; then add absolute times and recurrence.
5. **Add web search with sources.** Return current information with references,
   bounded requests, and clear handling of unavailable search.

The broader milestones below remain the plan. New priority choices should update
this section rather than silently marking later milestones complete.

## Foundation and core voice — v0.1 / v0.2

- [x] Python `src/` package, CLI, centralized settings, secrets handling, logging.
- [x] Linux audio device discovery, recording, playback, and error handling.
- [x] Whisper keyword spotting and optional openWakeWord integration.
- [x] Local faster-whisper transcription, VAD, confidence checks, bounded retries.
- [x] NIM, Groq, OpenRouter, and Ollama provider clients.
- [x] Heuristic request routing and `/fast`, `/strong`, `/deep`, `/local` overrides.
- [x] Time/date answers without an AI request.
- [x] Provider fallback before visible output; no splicing after a partial answer.
- [x] Piper speech, persistent Turbo worker, bounded sentence queues and interruption.
- [x] Playback captions; native Piper timing with duration estimates when unavailable.
- [x] Foreground voice requests take priority over background summaries.
- [x] Concise normal console and explicit development diagnostics.
- [x] Stage-level latency instrumentation and recorded model comparisons.
- [ ] Repeat live acceptance on the current combined build, including PC noise and pauses.
- [ ] Record sustained-session behavior and real provider-failure recovery.
- [ ] Track request/token totals and configurable provider budget limits.

Keep provider costs configurable; hosted free tiers and model availability can
change. Ollama requires a separately installed server/model and is not guaranteed
to be available just because the client is configured.

## Memory and conversation — v0.3, in development

- [x] SQLite conversations, durable facts, metadata, and keyed revisions.
- [x] Bounded short-term context and incremental background summaries across restarts.
- [x] Explicit `remember ...` and targeted `forget ...` commands.
- [x] Confirmation before conversational facts or corrections are saved.
- [x] Proposal cancellation on rejection, unrelated requests, expiry, or restart.
- [x] Ranked word/alias recall and local answers for supported saved facts.
- [x] Suppress known forgotten wording from model context; retain archived chat separately.
- [x] Automated restart, correction, and memory isolation tests.
- [x] Editable personality file and managed style updates/reset by voice.
- [x] Optional ambient follow-ups with intended-listener classification.
- [x] Linked interruption fragments and estimated playback context for continuation.
- [x] Keep internal interruption status out of spoken dialogue and provider reply examples.
- [ ] Teach a fact by voice, confirm it, restart, and recall it on the target desktop.
- [ ] Verify rejection and forgetting behavior through the actual microphone.
- [ ] Test the five-minute active ambient window and later context-gated follow-ups
      against speech addressed to other people.
- [ ] Finish [release acceptance](release-checks.md) before tagging stable v0.3.

Memory recall uses words and aliases, not embeddings. Forgetting is not full chat
archive erasure. Ambient classification estimates the intended listener; it does
not identify speakers. Those limitations remain explicit in the product docs.

## Installation and custom voice

- [x] Setup menu: RAPHAEL custom Turbo voice or default Amy/Piper.
- [x] Preserve existing settings and selected audio devices during setup.
- [x] CPU/Amy example configuration and installer pre-downloads.
- [x] Report missing custom reference, model files, or inference environment.
- [x] Download the exact Turbo model revision expected by the runtime.
- [x] Keep private references, recordings, weights, environments, and databases out of Git.
- [ ] Create the separate Python 3.12 Turbo environment automatically when selected.
- [ ] Add private reference import/backup with validation and actionable recovery steps.
- [ ] Validate a fresh machine with Amy, then the custom voice and fallback.
- [ ] Package or resolve the worker and voice manifest for custom Turbo use outside
      a source checkout; a wheel alone currently does not include those assets.
- [ ] Reduce optional inference dependencies after measuring what the worker actually needs.

The existing custom voice needs its original reference audio/transcript. A Git clone
contains the manifest, not those assets. The heavier Turbo installation should remain
optional. See [custom voice requirements](chatterbox-turbo-integration.md).

## Skills and actions — v0.4

- [x] Discover trusted installed modules exporting `ACTION` without editing the dispatcher.
- [x] Validate action names and arguments; reject ambiguous requests.
- [x] Enforce direct-address authorization for ambient side effects.
- [x] Support confirmation tied to exact arguments, expiry, and cancellation.
- [x] Bound blocking work with cooperative deadlines and report failures locally.
- [x] Read RAM usage, GPU temperature, and logical CPU core count.
- [x] Launch Discord/Vesktop, Firefox, Chromium, Steam, and VS Code/VSCodium by allowlist.
- [x] Recognize polite app requests, exact spelling corrections, and short-lived app references.
- [ ] Observe actual window opening and missing-app behavior on the target desktop.
- [ ] Accept model-selected calls through the same validated action registry.
- [ ] Return tool results to the provider without treating generated text as execution proof.
- [ ] Add relative reminders, persistence, listing, cancellation, and restart recovery.
- [ ] Add timezone-aware absolute reminders and recurring reminders.
- [ ] Add web search, source links, timeouts, and failure handling.
- [ ] Test end-to-end action chaining only after single actions are reliable.

No destructive action ships today. Test explicit confirmation end-to-end before
adding one. Action modules are trusted Python code, not sandboxed third-party plugins.
The interface and existing behavior are documented in [actions.md](actions.md).

## Dashboard — v0.5

- [ ] Add a local server and live status connection.
- [ ] Show idle/listening/thinking/speaking state, selected provider/model, and errors.
- [ ] Display conversation history, routing decisions, and measured response stages.
- [ ] Add useful settings controls and audio visualization.
- [ ] Review access controls before exposing the dashboard beyond localhost.
- [ ] Complete UI and accessibility checks against real desktop use.

Start with FastAPI, WebSocket, and a small web frontend. Add React/TypeScript if
needed; the Python assistant should not depend on an unnecessary second runtime.

## Messaging — v0.6

- [ ] Telegram text request/reply.
- [ ] Telegram voice input and optional spoken output.
- [ ] Discord text request/reply, permissions, and channel restrictions.
- [ ] Separate channel/user identity before sharing conversation memory.
- [ ] Rate limits, request budgets, and loop prevention.
- [ ] Consider Discord voice after text messaging is stable.
- [ ] Reassess WhatsApp as an optional extension, based on maintenance cost.

Opening the Discord desktop app is already implemented; a Discord messaging bot is not.

## Voice tone awareness — v0.7

- [ ] Extract pitch, energy, speech rate, pauses, and volume.
- [ ] Estimate tone with confidence rather than assigning a definitive emotional state.
- [ ] Supply useful estimates to conversation generation without overreacting.
- [ ] Evaluate across speakers, microphones, noise, sarcasm, and gaming audio.

Turbo's optional vocal event markers and conversational personality are existing
features; they are not an acoustic mood classifier.

## Desktop integration and Windows — v0.8

- [ ] Linux user service and optional autostart.
- [ ] Desktop notifications through a platform abstraction.
- [ ] Manual activation hotkey for noisy rooms or missed wake phrases.
- [ ] Windows audio, notifications, startup, launching, and hotkeys.
- [ ] Validate Windows parity for voice, memory, actions, and later integrations.

## Presence and proactive behavior — v0.9

- [ ] Optional webcam presence/motion detection.
- [ ] Event → trigger → condition → action execution.
- [ ] A bounded welcome-back greeting after room entry.
- [ ] Presence-triggered reminders.
- [ ] Quiet hours, Do Not Disturb, and independent camera/voice notification controls.
- [ ] Confidence thresholds and cooldowns tested against shadows, pets, screens, and noise.

## Integration and release — v1.0

- [ ] Exercise the combined voice, memory, actions, messaging, tone, and presence system.
- [ ] Repeat supported-platform acceptance and long-session failure recovery.
- [ ] Verify clean installation, upgrade, private-data backup, and uninstall behavior.
- [ ] Audit unused configuration/dependencies and misleading capability claims.
- [ ] Update user docs, changelog, and a demo with actually observed behavior.
- [ ] Tag releases only after their automated checks and live acceptance are complete.

## Working rules

- Keep commits focused and describe behavior and validation, not just file changes.
- Work on and push to `main` for this repository unless the user requests a branch.
  Fetch first and preserve remote changes; never force-push to resolve divergence.
- Keep models, API keys, recordings, transcripts, and conversation databases local.
- Record benchmark conditions and dates. Old measurements are evidence about that
  run, not guarantees for current models, hardware, or configuration.
- Keep automated tests distinct from real microphone, GPU, speaker, and desktop checks.
- Update this checklist when functionality changes; preserve detailed historical
  results in release notes rather than accumulating contradictory current claims.
