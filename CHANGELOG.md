# Changelog

## Unreleased — 0.3.6 development

- Enforce `/local` through reply fallback, running summaries, and ambient speech
  classification, retaining the policy across summary persistence and restart.
- Preserve unrelated facts when forgetting an absent topic, and keep old forgotten
  values suppressed when a different value is saved under the same key.
- Fix microphone stream replacement deadlocks and clean up failed stream starts.
  Require detected wake evidence to interrupt playback in wake mode.
- Expire pending persona edits and clear them on cancellation, farewell, mode
  changes, or unrelated requests. Expose `WAKE_MODELS` and print activation steps
  after custom wake training. Retry failed summaries without skipping dialogue.
- Bound STT startup and Turbo response waits, validate audio configuration earlier,
  hide API key entry, and restrict setup configuration files to owner access.
- Add regression coverage and CI for Python 3.10/3.14, frontend tests, lint,
  packaging, and an installed CLI smoke check.
- Add breathing, orbiting particles, flowing ribbons, and distinct voice-state
  animations to the orb. Cache geometry calculations, batch canvas draws, cap
  high-DPI resolution, and reduce frame rates while waiting and speaking.
- Buffer TTS playback in 1,024-frame blocks with configurable
  `TTS_PLAYBACK_LATENCY=0.12` to tolerate scheduling delays, and report underruns.
- Add `raphael web`, a PC-local desktop page using the existing microphone,
  speakers, conversation worker, memory, and actions. Display current speech,
  status, and mute/stop/shutdown controls without new dependencies.
- Replace the web conversation feed with a voice orb, a temporary current-reply
  speech bubble, and a message/command input. Animate the orb from runtime states;
  respect reduced motion and pause animation when the page is hidden. Show the
  bubble above a layered 3D surface mesh with purple/cyan bands and a luminous core.
- Polish the orb page with stable speech placement, readable replies with manual
  dismissal, larger controls, accessible completed-reply announcements, offline
  drafting, and request deadlines that recover from stalled connections.
- Add keyboard messages alongside voice listening, with `/mute` for microphone
  input, `/stop` for cancellation, `/exit` for shutdown, and `/help` for controls.
  Typed messages share the conversation worker, memory, and validated actions.
- Keep the owner-name keyboard prompt and its draft separate from background
  logs and progressive speech captions; restore terminal input mode on exit.
- Use plainspoken companion defaults, brief greetings and corrections, and
  direct honesty. Start a new conversation context so earlier verbose replies
  are not reused as style examples; preserve archived chats and saved facts.
- Keep archived playback-status notes out of assistant dialogue sent to providers,
  and filter echoed status markers from streamed/batch replies and TTS so they
  cannot be spoken as an answer.
- Add trusted local actions for system information and allowlisted Linux app
  launching, including polite requests and recent spelling corrections.
- Confirm conversational memory proposals before saving; retain explicit
  remember/forget commands and persistent recall.
- Add voice-requested personality preferences, contextual ambient follow-ups,
  and concise/development console modes.
- Integrate the persistent custom Chatterbox Turbo voice with Piper fallback;
  remove retired voice experiments and training tools.
- Offer custom RAPHAEL or default Amy in setup. Check missing custom assets,
  preserve existing settings, and use CPU/Amy for the fresh-install example.
- Pin Turbo downloads to the revision accepted by the worker, refreshing an
  incompatible cached inventory. Keep the custom reference assets private.
- Retain the later measured Nemotron 3 Super routing choice documented in
  [latency findings](docs/conversation-latency.md); earlier model changes below
  describe historical development states.
- Refresh installation instructions, usage documentation, and the roadmap to
  separate implemented behavior from pending live acceptance and future work.

## 0.3.6 — 2026-10-04 (development)

- Reveal AI captions letter by letter during playback, using native Piper audio
  alignments for word spans and interpolating letters within those spans. Include
  the output device's reported latency, and freeze partial captions on barge-in.
- Coordinate caption redraws with console logs. Preserve terminal width, secret
  masking, normal log formatting, and plain final snapshots for redirected output.
- Enable Piper's alignment dependency and patch voices in memory. Preserve model
  files and public synthesis results; unsupported timing uses a duration estimate.
- Keep complete replies out of INFO logs ahead of live captions, and display a
  plain text fallback when speech fails before any visible playback progress.

## 0.3.5 — 2026-10-04 (development)

- Add live AI speech transcripts at playback start, showing each streaming
  sentence while it plays. Include local replies and batch TTS; omit speech
  canceled before playback and clean Markdown using the same speech rules.
- Add `SHOW_AI_TRANSCRIPTS` and `--show-ai-transcripts` /
  `--no-show-ai-transcripts` overrides, independent of raw microphone diagnostics.
  Preserve the final response log and one assistant turn in persistent history.

## 0.3.4 — 2026-10-04 (development)

- Use active conversation state for ordinary follow-ups and topic changes. Valid
  uncertain intent favors continuing a recent exchange; clear evidence of another
  listener closes it. New, expired or reset sessions still require an address.
- Add `AMBIENT_FOLLOWUP_POLICY=conversation|strict`; conversation is the default.
  Strict retains high-confidence follow-up classification. Failed or malformed
  judgments remain silent, and inferred turns do not authorize memory writes.
- Classify assistant/other/uncertain listeners with recent exchange context;
  expose intent confidence and the selected policy in logs.
- Preserve structured NIM JSON before conversational cleanup so interpretation
  strings containing “Direct response:” or reasoning-tag literals stay intact.

## 0.3.3 — 2026-10-04 (development)

- Accept natural descriptions of recent spoken delivery, including “you sound
  like a robot” and brief conversational tags such as “do you know?” or “right”.
  Quoted speech, other listeners and unrelated appended instructions still need
  the ambient intent decision.
- Recover bounded clock questions ending in RAPHAEL's name when STT drops “it”,
  such as “What time is Raphael?”. Use the local clock and retain the original
  wording in history. Inferred address does not authorize memory writes.
- Answer normal trailing-name clock questions locally as well, avoiding a cloud
  request for “What's the time Raphael?”.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-10-04 (development)

- Accept recent feedback about spoken pace and delivery without a cloud speech
  gate or another wake phrase. Keep the original conversation window after an
  uncertain fragment; confirmed speech to someone else still ends it.
- Include speech feedback and answers to the assistant's last question in the
  follow-up classifier instructions.
- Add a Linux `gpu` installation extra for CUDA 12 cuBLAS and cuDNN 9, so command
  STT does not depend on a separate training environment's libraries.
- Run actual CUDA inference during background model loading before reporting
  STT ready; missing lazy-loaded libraries trigger the startup CPU fallback.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-10-03 (development)

- Replace the retired default NIM model with Nemotron 3.5 Lightning and keep
  thinking disabled for conversational replies.
- Try the configured NIM backup immediately on HTTP 404/410 in both batch and
  streaming modes. Preserve transient retries and cancellation without restarting
  a partially emitted answer. Handle usage-only and terminal SSE events.
- Resume an unanswered, directly linked question when a false interruption
  produces empty STT output. Keep original history once, reject expired or
  unrelated requests, and avoid replaying memory writes or partial playback.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-03 (development)

- Speak completed sentences while provider generation continues. Filter reasoning
  across token boundaries and retain code in history without reading it aloud.
- Cancel network reads, queued speech, and pending synthesis on interruption.
  Preserve completed sentences and estimated partial playback for continuation.
- Keep interrupted questions and additions together before the ambient reply
  decision. Record original user fragments separately and one assistant response.
- Budget additional CUDA STT retry models against available VRAM; reuse the
  primary model under training load and release temporary CUDA retry models.
- Retain SQLite facts, corrections, forgetting, and restart recall. Batch older
  conversation summaries in the background using economical routing.
- Select ambient listening, transcript diagnostics, and headphone speech barge-in
  through `.env`. The GPU launcher works without flags.
- Align package metadata, runtime version, and startup banner at 0.3.0.

Live microphone, training-load, and restart acceptance remain pending in
[`docs/release-checks.md`](docs/release-checks.md). A stable v0.3 tag has not been created.
