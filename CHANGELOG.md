# Changelog

## 0.3.6 — 2026-10-04 (development)

- Reveal AI captions letter by letter during playback, using native Piper audio
  alignments for word spans and interpolating letters within those spans. Include
  the output device's reported latency, and freeze partial captions on barge-in.
- Coordinate caption redraws with console logs. Preserve terminal width, secret
  masking, normal log formatting, and plain final snapshots for redirected output.
- Enable Piper's alignment dependency and patch voices in memory. Preserve model
  files and public synthesis results; unsupported timing uses a duration estimate.
- Keep complete replies out of INFO logs ahead of live captions, and display a
  plain text fallback when speech fails before any visible playback progress.

## 0.3.5 — 2026-10-04 (development)

- Add live AI speech transcripts at playback start, showing each streaming
  sentence while it plays. Include local replies and batch TTS; omit speech
  canceled before playback and clean Markdown using the same speech rules.
- Add `SHOW_AI_TRANSCRIPTS` and `--show-ai-transcripts` /
  `--no-show-ai-transcripts` overrides, independent of raw microphone diagnostics.
  Preserve the final response log and one assistant turn in persistent history.

## 0.3.4 — 2026-10-04 (development)

- Use active conversation state for ordinary follow-ups and topic changes. Valid
  uncertain intent favors continuing a recent exchange; clear evidence of another
  listener closes it. New, expired or reset sessions still require an address.
- Add `AMBIENT_FOLLOWUP_POLICY=conversation|strict`; conversation is the default.
  Strict retains high-confidence follow-up classification. Failed or malformed
  judgments remain silent, and inferred turns do not authorize memory writes.
- Classify assistant/other/uncertain listeners with recent exchange context;
  expose intent confidence and the selected policy in logs.
- Preserve structured NIM JSON before conversational cleanup so interpretation
  strings containing “Direct response:” or reasoning-tag literals stay intact.

## 0.3.3 — 2026-10-04 (development)

- Accept natural descriptions of recent spoken delivery, including “you sound
  like a robot” and brief conversational tags such as “do you know?” or “right”.
  Quoted speech, other listeners and unrelated appended instructions still need
  the ambient intent decision.
- Recover bounded clock questions ending in RAPHAEL's name when STT drops “it”,
  such as “What time is Raphael?”. Use the local clock and retain the original
  wording in history. Inferred address does not authorize memory writes.
- Answer normal trailing-name clock questions locally as well, avoiding a cloud
  request for “What's the time Raphael?”.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-10-04 (development)

- Accept recent feedback about spoken pace and delivery without a cloud speech
  gate or another wake phrase. Keep the original conversation window after an
  uncertain fragment; confirmed speech to someone else still ends it.
- Include speech feedback and answers to the assistant's last question in the
  follow-up classifier instructions.
- Add a Linux `gpu` installation extra for CUDA 12 cuBLAS and cuDNN 9, so command
  STT does not depend on a separate training environment's libraries.
- Run actual CUDA inference during background model loading before reporting
  STT ready; missing lazy-loaded libraries trigger the startup CPU fallback.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-10-03 (development)

- Replace the retired default NIM model with Nemotron 3.5 Lightning and keep
  thinking disabled for conversational replies.
- Try the configured NIM backup immediately on HTTP 404/410 in both batch and
  streaming modes. Preserve transient retries and cancellation without restarting
  a partially emitted answer. Handle usage-only and terminal SSE events.
- Resume an unanswered, directly linked question when a false interruption
  produces empty STT output. Keep original history once, reject expired or
  unrelated requests, and avoid replaying memory writes or partial playback.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-03 (development)

- Speak completed sentences while provider generation continues. Filter reasoning
  across token boundaries and retain code in history without reading it aloud.
- Cancel network reads, queued speech, and pending synthesis on interruption.
  Preserve completed sentences and estimated partial playback for continuation.
- Keep interrupted questions and additions together before the ambient reply
  decision. Record original user fragments separately and one assistant response.
- Budget additional CUDA STT retry models against available VRAM; reuse the
  primary model under training load and release temporary CUDA retry models.
- Retain SQLite facts, corrections, forgetting, and restart recall. Batch older
  conversation summaries in the background using economical routing.
- Select ambient listening, transcript diagnostics, and headphone speech barge-in
  through `.env`. The GPU launcher works without flags.
- Align package metadata, runtime version, and startup banner at 0.3.0.

Live microphone, training-load, and restart acceptance remain pending in
[`docs/release-checks.md`](docs/release-checks.md). A stable v0.3 tag has not been created.
